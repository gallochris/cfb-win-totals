# College football opponent win totals and schedules 

### About

Welcome! This project provides the 2023 schedules and opponent win totals for college football teams in the FBS. 

Check it out here: https://blessyourchart.shinyapps.io/cfbwintotals/

It's intended to be used to look up the schedule of a team and understand the expectations of that team, and its opponents.

After the season starts, the information likely becomes less useful. Who knows, I might add results to track the win totals as the season develops this fall. Stay tuned. 

#### Data sources: 
-  win totals from [vegasinsider.com](https://www.vegasinsider.com/college-football/odds/win-totals/)
-  schedules from [cfbfastR](https://github.com/sportsdataverse/cfbfastR)
-  logos from [cfbplotR](https://kazink36.github.io/cfbplotR/articles/tutorial.html)

#### What this project includes:

-   pre-season win totals for each team

#### What it does NOT include:

-   odds from different sportbooks
-   picks on over/under win totals
